Idea#1: WeServe - Connecting  pro-bono and student volunteers to the NGOs around the world. 

When NGOs start a social project they usually do not have resources to apply technology platform and best practices. So they often  start with manual work and paper based system to collect  data and make decisions. They need help with things other than technology such as consulting, efficiency and applying proven techniques. This platform connects pro-bono consultants and students/software developers  volunteers to the NGOs. 
NGO posts the project. Students and pro  bono consultants creates their profile, interests and expertise and timeline they might be available to work/help. System applies intelligent algorithm to match them. 
Skills: Java, Java Script, MySQL
