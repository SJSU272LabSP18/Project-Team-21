Idea#1: WeServe - Connecting  pro-bono and student volunteers to the NGOs around the world. 

When NGOs start a social project they usually do not have resources to apply technology platform and best practices. So they often  start with manual work and paper based system to collect  data and make decisions. They need help with things other than technology such as consulting, efficiency and applying proven techniques. This platform connects pro-bono consultants and students/software developers  volunteers to the NGOs. 
NGO posts the project. Students and pro  bono consultants creates their profile, interests and expertise and timeline they might be available to work/help. System applies intelligent algorithm to match them. 
Skills: Java, Java Script, MySQL

Idea#2:  Lucy helps keep our seniors happy and  engaged
#1 problems our seniors (over 80) face today is loneliness and isolation. According to the U.S. Census Bureau 11 million, or 28% of people aged 65 and older, lived alone at the time of the census. As people get older, their likelihood of living alone only increases. Additionally, more and more older adults do not have children, reports the AARP, and that means fewer family members to provide company and care as those adults become seniors.
1. Senior isolation increases the risk of mortality.
2. Feelings of loneliness can negatively affect both physical and mental health.
3. Perceived loneliness contributes to cognitive decline and risk of dementia.
4. Social isolation makes seniors more vulnerable to elder abuse.
5. Loneliness in seniors is a major risk factor for depression.

Lucy is an effort to use technology and a  group of student volunteers to solve the problem  of social isolation of seniors. Lucy is a skill developed for Amazon Alexa device echo dot which sits in seniorâ€™s room. A group of student volunteers write personal emails to our seniors . Lucy reads those emails from a server to seniors as they come or at certain time. If seniors can share stories and Lucy collects them that would be great.
